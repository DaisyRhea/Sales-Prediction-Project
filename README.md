Prediction of Retail Sales using Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
 We have sales data for three years which depends on time. our aim is to predict the sales given a certain city and a certain type of retail store. 
 We used a Recurrent Neural Network Model with LSTM to predict the outcome i.e. sales.
